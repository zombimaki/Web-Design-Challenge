# Web-Design-Challenge

In this challenge we create a website with multiple pages to dispaly images of matplotlib charts from a previous activity. This project does the following:

1. Includes an index.html file in the root directory that points to the main.html file in theWeb Visualizations folder.
2. Includes a navbar that is used in each html file with links to the chart pages, comparison page, and data page.
3. Using the data_to_html.py file we can take the results that saves to /WebVisualizations/Resources/cities.html and include the code in the data.html file.
4. Includes a splash page with the main.html that gives an overview of the project as well as small chart pictures that link to the individual chart pages.
5. Includes a page for each chart found in the /WebVisualizations/Resources/Assets folder.
6. Includes a style.css file to apply the appropriate formats including formatting for when the size of the page falls below 900px.
